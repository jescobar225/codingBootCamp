            <p class="landingInfo">Hello and welcome to Onyx! Our website is dedicated to gathering information and resources regarding the adoption of pets in your area. For the time being, we only have the means for cat and dog adoptions, but we hope to expand our resource library to include all types of pets in the future (from playful ferrets to sunbathing bearded dragons and anything in between).      
            </p>
            <h3>December's Featured Presentation: Pets for Life Baton Rouge </h3>  
            <p class="landingInfo">This month, we are featuring an introductory video into one of our partner's (Companion Animal Alliance) program called Pets for Life Baton Rouge. With this program established in June 2017, CAA began strategic outreach in 70805 and 70802, Baton Rougeâ€™s most under-served community where 38% of residents live below poverty, bringing free animal medical care, services and information to people and their pets who live in communities that lack access to affordable veterinary care. PFLBR's philosophy promotes the understanding that a lack of financial means does not equate to a lack of love felt for and provided to a pet.
