                    <p>In 2005 Spay Baton Rouge was born to help make spaying and neutering affordable to pet owners who otherwise couldn't afford this important but often cost prohibitive procedure for their pets. Since then, the organization has helped to spay or neuter over 15,600 cats and dogs in the Baton Rouge area, including both people's owned pets and stray, feral, and community animals.</p>

                <p>There are many benefits to adopting a pet, but a great one is that many rescues/shelters offer services at a lower cost or included in your adoption fee which you would otherwise have to pay for separately at a veterinarian on your first visit with your new pet.<p> 
                <p>Our partners offer the following services included in their adoption fees:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Spay/Neuter</li>
                    <li>Testing for diseases</li>
                    <li>De-flea/de-worming treaments</li>
                    <li>Microchipping</li>
                    <li>Age-appropriate vaccinations</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These services can cost over $400 at certain veterinarian clinics, so our partners make it very affordable to adopt by including these services in your adoption fees.
