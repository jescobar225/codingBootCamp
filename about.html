                    <p>Throughout the years, I've taken care of many animals. My family's iguanas and tortoises when I was a kid, my aunt's three dogs when I first moved to the U.S., and many friends' pets when they would go out of town. But these were never truly mine. So in 2019, I decided I was ready to adopt my first pet and headed over to Cat Haven. The only experience I had with cats was with my friends' when I would go to their houses or apartments, but they seemed like a good first pet, specially for someone living in an apartment. That's where I found the namesake for this website, my cat, Onyx (pictured right). 
                    </p>
                    <p>I've had Onyx for two and a half years now and he has taught me a lot about having a pet, specially a feline. They like to let you know that they are not like dogs and will give and accept affection on their time. But overall, it has been a very rewarding experience and I couldn't imagine my life without him. Because of this, I thought that it would be great to create this website to share information and facilitate the early stages of this experience.
