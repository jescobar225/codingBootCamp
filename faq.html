                    <p class="question">What are some reasons to adopt a pet instead of buying one?</p>
                    <p class="answer">- When adopting a pet you are saving a life, combating the practice of "puppy mills," getting a great animal, and helping more than just one animal. It has also been proven that having a pet is physically, emotionally, and psychologically beneficial. Animals give you unconditional love, give you a sense of purpose and fulfillment, and lessen feelings of loneliness. These are just a few of the many benefits of adopting instead of buying a pet.</p>
                    <p class="question">What is a "puppy mill?"</p>
                    <p class="answer">- Puppy mills are operations in which animals are bred factory-style, usually in very poor conditions for both the parents and the puppies. These living conditions result in poor health and behavioral issues for the animals being bred. 
                    <p class="question">Why are adopted pets usually such great animals?</p>
                    <p class="answer">- Pets adopted from a shelter usually make great pets because many of them are there due to human problems like a break-up or a move where the pet wasn't taken into consideration. These animals are often happy and healthy and ready for someone to take them home. Many of these are already house-trained and love being around families. </p>
                    <p class="question">Is it expensive to adopt from a shelter/rescue?</p>
                    <p class="answer">- It is much cheaper to adopt a pet than to buy one from a pet store or a breeder. Most shelters/rescues have a flat adoption fee which includes neutering/spaying, vaccinations, and sometimes microchipping. Depending on what kind of animal you adopt, you could also save money on training and housebreaking expenses. </p>
